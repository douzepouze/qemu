Put test and demo programs for the micro:bit here.

This directory will not be merged into qemu.git/master.  It is purely for
sharing small test programs during development.

The programs can be MicroPython, Javascript/Blocks, Nordic SDK, etc.  Please
include both the source code and the .hex file.

Make sure changes to this directory are in separate commits from work you'd
like merged into qemu.git/master.
